<h2>About Learning Pages</h2>

<hr />
<p><a href="https://mwlsdotcom.github.io">Home</a></p>

<p>The Learning Pages project is the creation of an advert-free site which will be providing free learning resources for learners, trainers and educators. It has been motivated by the desire that learning should not be lost.</p>

<p>As well as the usual resources you would expect on a site that is dedicated to educating, training and learning, you will also find resources that reflect my personal learning journey.</p>

<p>If you would like to support this work with microdonations, please go to <a href="https://flattr.com/@LearningPages">flattr.com/@LearningPages</a> and sign up for a contributor account.
