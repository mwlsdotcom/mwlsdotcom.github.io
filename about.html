<h2>About Mike Wills Learning Services</h2>
<hr>
<a href=index.html>Home</a>  
  
<p><a href=https://mwls.com/>Mike&nbsp;Wills&nbsp;Learning&nbsp;Services</a> facilitates individual and organisational learning.</p>

<p>I also run the <a href=https://learningpages.org/ target=blank>Learning&nbsp;Pages</a> project which is an advert-free site that provides free, online resources for learners, trainers and educators. It has been motivated by the desire that learning should not be lost.
    
<p>As well as the usual resources you would expect on a site that is dedicated to educating, training and learning, you will also find resources that reflect my personal learning journey.</p>

<p>If you would like to support this work with donations, microdonations or by taking out a monthly subscription, please go to the <a href=https://learningpages.org/support-us.html target=blank>Learning&nbsp;Pages&nbsp;Donation&nbsp;Page</a>.</p>

<p>During the pandemic, I realised how important books are for leisure, mental health and learning. This inspired me to create an online bookshop - <a href=https://lymebaybooks.co.uk target=blank>Lyme Bay Books</a> - with a wide range of categories.</p>

<p class=notes><i>Learning Pages</i> and <i>Lyme Bay Books</i> are trading names of <i>Mike Wills Learning Services</i>.</p>
