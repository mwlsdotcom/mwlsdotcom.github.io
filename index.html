<p>Mike Wills Learning Services provides learning resources for learners, trainers and educators. It has been motivated by the desire that learning should not be lost. As well as the usual resources you would expect on a site that is dedicated to educating, training and learning, you will also find resources that reflect my personal learning journey.</p>

<p>Currently I am working on my <a href=https://mwls.com/learningpages/>Learning Pages</a> project which is the creation of an advert-free site  that provides free, online learning resources for learners, trainers and educators. If you would like to support this work with donations or microdonations or by taking out a monthly subscription, please go to the <a href=https://mwls.com/learningpages/donate.html>LearningPages Donation Page</a>.<br/><br/>
